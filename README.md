# Cotton-Prediction-using-ResNet50
Cotton Prediction using ResNet50
Overview
This project implements a cotton disease prediction model using the ResNet50 architecture. The goal is to classify images of cotton plants into different categories based on the presence of diseases. The ResNet50 deep learning model is employed for its effectiveness in handling complex image recognition tasks.

Key Features
ResNet50 Model: Leveraging the power of the ResNet50 convolutional neural network for accurate image classification.

Dataset: Trained on a dataset containing images of healthy and diseased cotton plants, contributing to the model's ability to distinguish between various diseases.

Jupyter Notebook: The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (cotton_prediction_ResNet50.ipynb), making it easy for users to understand and modify the code.
